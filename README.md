# Knight Grade Check

This application was built in collaboration with my Wife.  She voiced concern over how much time was spent going over grades with students and how their next assignment or test would impact their grade.  She asked if I could do anything to help her out (which of course I said I could).  I set out and built a simple concept in HTML, CSS and JS [Here](https://github.com/J3ffJessie/KMS-Grade-Checker).  After showing her this example and explaining what changes I would make and how I would go about it, she approved and I set out and got to work.

## Building the project
Tech used for building this project includes:

![React](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=React&color=222222&logo=React&logoColor=61DAFB&label=)

As well as just plain Maths(Yuck!).  All mathematical calculations were confirmed by inquiring with my Wife who is a Math Teacher.

# Next Steps
What would my next steps with this application be?  Well I would love to integrate with the schools grading platform [PowerSchool](https://www.powerschool.com/) and utilize their API to allow the students to either pull their grade within the application using their API or to auto populate their grade by utilizing OAUTH and logging the students into Powerschool and then allowing them to calculate their grade from there.

The only downfall is that the API for PowerSchool is protected and can only be accessed by School Admin or Teachers and Staff.  Could I possibly swing using my Wife's credentials to gain access and do what I want to do? Possibly, but it isn't worth risking her career to integrate something so minial.  I have reached out to inquire about access individually as a developer, but have yet to hear back from their IT team.

<summary>Setup and Running This Web Application</summary>
<br>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
